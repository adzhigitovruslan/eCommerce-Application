    "en-US": "Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. Players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world with infinite terrain, discovering and extracting raw materials, crafting tools and items, and building structures or earthworks. Depending on the game mode, players can fight computer-controlled \"mobs\" and cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, where players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets."

The absence of a predefined story allows players to set their own goals, whether it's surviving against hostile creatures, embarking on epic adventures, or building sprawling landscapes. Minecraft's open-ended nature, multiplayer capabilities, and vibrant modding community ensure that players can create and share unique narratives and experiences within the game's blocky universe. This creative freedom has played a significant role in the game's widespread appeal and longevity."
